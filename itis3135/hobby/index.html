            <h2>What Exactly is 3D Animation?</h2>
            <p>3D animation is the process of creating moving digital characters, objects, and enviroments within a three-dimensional space. Unlike 2D animation, where images are drawn frame by frame, 3D animation relies on models, rigging, and movement controlled by software.</p>
            <img src="../images/Dev_Stock_Compress.jpg" alt="Stock Photo Dev" width="400">
            <h3>How Does It Work?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Modeling</strong> - Creating the digital character or object.</li>
                <li><strong>Rigging</strong> - Adding a skeletal structure to allow movement.</li>
                <li><strong>Animation</strong> - Moving the model using keyframes or motion capture.</li>
                <li><strong>Rendering</strong> - Generating the final animation with lighting and textures.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Why 3D Animation?</h3>
            <p>3D animation is used in movies, games, VR, and even medical simulations! Whether you're an aspiring artist or just curious about the process, learning 3D animation can open up a world of creative possibilities!</p>
            <h3>Getting Started...</h3>
            <p>If you're new to 3D animation, start with beginner friendly software like Blender (free) or Autodesk Maya (industry standard & expensive paid subscription). There are countless online tutorials and courses available to help you learn at your own pace.</p>

        <!-- This is the ABOUT section-->
        <section id="about">
            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hey everyone! My name is Bogdan Gerasymenko, and I've been passionate about 3D animation for over 7 years! I started my journey in animation using Blender, and over time, I expanded my skills into Maya, Unreal Engine, and other industry-standard tools/software.</p>
            <img src="../images/Bogdan_Photo.jpg" alt="Bogdan Gerasymenko Photo" width="400">
            <h3>My Journey Into 3D Animation</h3>
            <p>Truth be told, I’ve been experimenting with animation for quite some time now. Ever since I was 12, I would make little LEGO and clay stop-motion videos in my room, completely falling in love with the process. Later, my parents got me an iPad and a pen to start drawing digitally—a gift that opened up a whole new world of creativity for me.</p>
            <p>It wasn’t until 2018, while scrolling through YouTube, that I stumbled upon an animation reel by Andrew Ford. It was a motion capture reel for Uncharted 4, and I was absolutely blown away by the fluidity, realism, and sheer craftsmanship of the work. That moment changed everything for me... I knew I had to give 3D animation a try.</p>

            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bOOXAcEEni0?si=PWLll5sGzF6UlZM8" title="YouTube video player" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

            <p>At the time, I didn’t have a powerful computer or a big budget, so I started with Blender, drawn to its free and open-source nature. Since my PC was weak and couldn't handle complex scenes, I focused on viewmodel animations—first-person weapon and hand animations—because they required less processing power and were easier to run. This allowed me to learn animation fundamentals without being held back by hardware limitations.</p>
            <p>As I experimented and pushed myself to learn more, I also began saving up for a better PC that could handle more complex scenes and rendering. For about a year, I resold candy at school, eventually saving enough to build my own custom rig.</p>
            <p>From that point on, I dedicated myself to practice and refinement. I landed opportunities to work on various indie projects and game mods, gaining valuable real-world experience. Some of the projects I’ve contributed to include Squad: Vietnam, Half-Life: Vance, Hunt Down The Freeman, and currently Exorush, where I serve as the lead animator.</p>
            <p>Animation isn’t just a hobby for me—it’s my passion. It’s the perfect blend of storytelling, problem-solving, and technical artistry, and I can’t wait to see where this journey takes me next.</p>
            <h3>Why I Love Animation</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Storytelling:</strong> Animation allows me to bring stories to life in ways live-action can't.</li>
                <li><strong>Creativity:</strong> The ability to design worlds, characters, and movements from scratch is amazing.</li>
                <li><strong>Problem-Solving:</strong> Whether it's fine tuning a walk cycle or cleaning up motion capture, animation keeps me thinking and improving.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>What I'm Working On</h3>
            <p>Currently, I’m the lead animator on Exorush, a fast-paced shooter set in the future. My role covers character animation, viewmodel animation, motion capture, and overall animation direction. In addition to creating high-quality animations, I’m also guiding and teaching two animators on the team, helping them refine their skills and maintain a consistent animation style across the project.</p>
            <p>Beyond Exorush, I’m always experimenting with new animation techniques, refining my workflow, and studying different styles—from hyper-realistic mocap work to more stylized, exaggerated animation. I’m also diving deeper into Unreal Engine 5, exploring ways to seamlessly integrate animations into gameplay to enhance player immersion.</p>
            <p>At the end of the day, my goal is to enhance gameplay through movement, whether that’s through cinematics, gameplay animation, or first-person mechanics. Every new project, big or small, is another opportunity to grow, refine my craft, and bring characters to life in ways that feel fluid, responsive, and immersive.</p>
            <h3>Let's Connect!</h3>
            <p>If you're into animation or just want to talk about games, movies, or creative projects, feel free to reach out! I'm always happy to discuss animation techniques, industry trends, or bounce around cool ideas.</p>

        <!-- This is the WHY section-->
        <section id="why">
            <h2>Why I Chose Game Animation</h2>
            <p>Game animation isn’t just about making characters move—it’s about creating a seamless, immersive experience that players can feel. Every action, reaction, and movement needs to serve gameplay while maintaining the artistic vision of the game.</p>
            <h3>Animation That Feels Good to Play</h3>
            <p>In games, animation isn’t just visual... it’s interactive. Whether it’s a tight first-person reload, a responsive melee attack, or a fluid traversal system, animations should feel intuitive and satisfying. My goal is to create animations that not only look great but also enhance the player's control and feedback.</p>
            <h3>Blending Art and Function</h3>
            <p>Unlike film, where animation is purely cinematic, game animation has to serve the mechanics. Every frame needs to support the player’s actions, ensuring that movement is clear, responsive, and fun. Balancing realism with gameplay readability is what makes game animation such an exciting challenge.</p>
            <h3>Bringing Combat and Action to Life</h3>
            <p>From weapon handling to enemy AI behaviors, animation plays a huge role in making combat feel impactful. A good hit reaction, an expressive reload, or a weighty melee attack can make the difference between a game feeling satisfying or stiff. I love diving into motion capture, hand-keyed animation, and physics-based systems to make combat animations feel dynamic and immersive.</p>
            <h3>Creating Engaging First-Person Experiences</h3>
            <p>First-person animation is an art of its own—it’s the player's direct point of view and needs to feel natural yet expressive. Every hand movement, weapon swap, and environmental interaction should enhance immersion while keeping gameplay smooth and responsive.</p>
            <h3>A Passion for Gameplay-Driven Animation</h3>
            <p>What drew me into game animation was the ability to merge art with interactivity. Seeing animations not just as cutscenes, but as tools to enhance gameplay flow, pacing, and feel, is what keeps me excited about every new project. Whether it’s refining combat mechanics, polishing traversal, or designing responsive movement, I’m always looking for ways to push the experience further.</p>
