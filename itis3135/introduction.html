            <li><b>Personal Background:</b> I was born on December 22, 2003, in White Plains, New York. My father's job required us to move frequently, which has shaped my life in profound ways. I've attended over 12 different schools and had the pleasure of meeting people from diverse backgrounds. These experiences have allowed me to embrace and appreciate a variety of cultures and traditions, enriching my perspective and broadening my understanding of the world.</li>
            <li><b>Academic Background:</b> I began my journey in UNCC in Fall of 2022, and plan to graduate in Spring 2026, with a Bachelor in IT and a Master in Cybersecurity. </li>
            <li><b>Background in this subject:</b> Computers and technology is the future. Thus, it’s crucial to stay up-to-date with the recent developments in technology and strive to build the future for our country and society.</li>
            <li><b>Primary Computer Platform:</b> Windows Desktop & Laptop</li>
            <li><b>Courses I'm Taking & Why:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>ITIS 4360 - Human Centered AI:</b> It’s a technical elective, but I really would like to learn more about AI and how crucial it is into our everyday lives.</li>
                    <li><b>ITCS 4230 - Intro to Game Design & Development:</b> It’s a technical elective, but I’ve always was interested in working in the game industry, so it’s a class that I was interested in checking out and connecting with people.</li>
                    <li><b>CJUS 1511 - Foundation of Criminal Justice:</b> It’s an elective, but coming from a family of lawyers and business men, I was curious to see what they’ve had to learn and endure.</li>
                    <li><b>ITCS 4010 - Introduction to Biometrics:</b> It’s a technical elective, but I was curious to check it out and learn more about this field, considering how much its gradually rising.</li>
                    <li><b>ITIS 3135 - Web Based Application Design and Development:</b> It’s a required class, but I chose it because I’m interested to learn more about making websites, and also I’ve taken von Briesen before, and he’s a fun professor!
